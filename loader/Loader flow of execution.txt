C64																Drive
=====															======
1 - Auto-loader hijacks a BASIC vector and 
loads the main loader using KERNAL routines
2 - Main loader
		-sets expected sentinel for loader code
		-Instructs drive to load 18/11 and execute it
																3-Loads sector 18/11 and executes it
																4-The code loads sector 18/12 using 1541 ROM routines
																-Uses expected sentinel to set up load jobs
																-Clears expected sentinel
																5-Uses an execute job to start executing from beginning of same buffer
																invoke a sector load routine for each main code sector
																	-The routine reads a raw GCR sector, decodes it and fast-sends it over serial
																	-First sector: 19/12
																-When the track changes, the job is finished and a new one created to work on the new track
																		
		6-reads main data from serial bus in fast-load mode
		7-decrypts rest of the loader code
		8-instructs drive to read sector 18/8 using KERNAL
																-Load sector 18/8 into a buffer
		9-performs a checksum on the sector buffer
		10-instructs drive to read and execute 18/8
																11-executes code of 18/8
																12-decrypts its own encrypted code
																13-performs copy protection check (wide-track validation)
																14-sets expected sentinel
																15-clears out the loaded code
		16-reads expected sentinel from 18/8 execution buffer
		17-checksums the main code decryption routine
		18-computes main checksum transformation values based
		on previous checksums
		19-decrypts main code using a dynamic key
		20-launches the main game code
