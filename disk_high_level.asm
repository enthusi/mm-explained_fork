 * Disk I/O high-level helpers (C64 ⇄ 1541-style drive over IEC): sector read/write,
 * streaming, and physical geometry stepping with robust retry + diagnostics.
 *
 * Summary:
 *   High-level wrapper layer around low-level IEC byte I/O. 
 *
 * 	Provides routines to:
 *     • seed and advance a physical “sector chain” (track/sector cursor)
 *     • read a chosen sector into a fixed buffer ($0300)
 *     • stream bytes across sector boundaries with automatic refills
 *     • copy streamed data into RAM
 *     • write one or more sectors from a linear memory buffer
 *
 *   The on-wire read protocol uses 0x01-prefixed escape/control sequences for EOD,
 *   sync requests, and error signaling. Writes stream an exact 256-byte payload.
 *
 * Hardware / Memory Map:
 *   • processor_port_register ($0001): maps I/O in/out around IEC calls.
 *   • vic_border_color_register ($D020): set green on fatal protocol error (debug).
 *   • SECTOR_BUFFER ($0300..$03FF): fixed 256-byte read buffer (page-aligned).
 *   • Must execute from RAM: routines rely on self-modifying code (patch abs operands).
 *
 * Protocol (drive → host, during reads):
 *   01 01  = literal 0x01 (escaped, store and continue)
 *   01 81  = end-of-data (success → C=0)
 *   01 11  = error (failure → C=1)
 *   01 21  = sync request (resynchronize, then continue)
 *   other  = fatal: border=green, infinite hang (debug visibility)
 *
 * Calling Conventions (registers / globals):
 *   • Track/Sector inputs: X=track, Y=sector for single-sector ops.
 *   • Pointers: disk_dest_ptr/disk_src_ptr are (lo/hi) globals
 * 	• Routines patch abs operands inline:
 *       - disk_store_abs / disk_load_abs / disk_dest_store_abs labels.
 *   • Streaming state: current_track/current_sector, disk_buf_off advance across sectors.
 *   • Geometry: max_sector_index_by_track holds 0-based max sector index per track.
 *   • Mapping $01: set to MAP_IO_ON only for the duration of low-level IEC calls.
 *
 * Error Handling & Diagnostics:
 *   • Reads/writes with wrappers retry indefinitely on failure, showing DISK_ERROR_MSG
 *     via print_message_wait_for_button until the operation succeeds.
 *   • disk_read_sector_into_buffer records last_track_loaded/last_sector_loaded on success.
 *   • Fatal/unknown read control code → green border + hang (debug).
 *
 * Self-Modifying Code (SMC) Sites:
 *   • disk_read_sector: patches STA $FFFF,X (disk_store_abs) to disk_dest_ptr.
 *   • disk_write_sector: patches LDA $FFFF,X (disk_load_abs) to disk_src_ptr.
 *   • disk_stream_copy: patches STA $FFFF (disk_dest_store_abs) to destination,
 *     then increments the inlined operand to walk memory.
 *
 * Public routines:
 *   disk_init_chain                 Seed start_track/start_sector and clear chain state.
 *   disk_init_chain_and_read        Init chain, load (X=offset,Y=step), fall through to seek+read.
 *   disk_seek_read               	Step Y sectors from start_*, set disk_buf_off=X, read into $0300.
 *   disk_stream_copy          		Copy N streamed bytes to RAM using inlined STA operand.
 *   disk_stream_next_byte           Return next byte from stream; auto-refill on $FF→$00 wrap.
 *   disk_write_linear  				Write ceil(N/256) sectors from a linear buffer with retries.
 *   disk_reset                      Send DISK_CMD_RESET to the drive (no params).
 *
 * Private routines:
 *   disk_read_sector_into_buffer    Read (current_*) with retry; update last_*_loaded on success.
 *   disk_write_sector               Send DISK_CMD_WRITE and stream 256 bytes from disk_src_ptr.
 *   disk_next_sector_phys    		++sector; wrap to 0 and ++track when beyond per-track max.
 *
 * Table:
 *   max_sector_index_by_track       Table of per-track **max sector index** (0-based).
 *
 * Arguments / Returns (conventions used across routines):
 *   • Unless stated otherwise, A/X/Y are clobbered by low-level I/O; flags are not a contract.
 *   • Carry is used for read/write status in leaf protocol routines (C=0 success, C=1 error).
 *   • Globals updated: current_track/current_sector, disk_buf_off, last_*_loaded, disk_src_ptr/disk_dest_ptr.
 *
 * Edge Cases & Preconditions:
 *   • disk_stream_copy requires non-zero 16-bit count; zero would underflow/loop forever.
 *   • disk_write_linear rounds byte count up to whole sectors:
 *       sectors_to_write = hi + (lo != 0).
 *   • disk_next_sector_phys does not clamp at end-of-disk; caller policy applies.
 *
 * External Dependencies (entry addresses expected to be linked/provided):
 *   print_message_wait_for_button, iec_send_cmd, iec_sync,
 *   iec_recv_byte, iec_send_byte, disk_read_sector (internal leaf),
 *   disk_write_sector (internal leaf) — see individual routine headers below.

 * Arguments:
 *   X                         	Destination address low byte.

 *
 * Description:
 *   1) Patch the low/high operand bytes of `STA $FFFF` (SMC) using X/Y so writes
 *      land at the caller’s destination.
 *   2) Loop:
 *        • A ← disk_stream_next_byte()   	; may trigger a sector refill.

 * disk_write_linear — write N sectors from a linear buffer (retries on error)
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Writes a sequence of sectors starting at (start_track, start_sector), sourcing
 *   each 256-byte payload from successive pages of a linear buffer beginning at disk_src_ptr.
 *
 *   For each sector: map I/O in, call disk_write_sector.
 * 	On failure, print DISK_ERROR_MSG and retry the same sector until it succeeds. 
 * 	After each successful write, advance to the next valid (track, sector), 
 * 	bump disk_src_ptr by +256, and continue until all sectors have been written.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   X / Y                         disk_src_ptr (lo/hi): base of the first 256-byte page to write.
 *   start_track                   Starting track number.
 *   start_sector                  Starting sector index (0-based).
 *   disk_copy_count_hi			  Total byte count; sectors_to_write is computed as:
 *   disk_copy_count_lo 			  hi + (lo != 0). The hi byte is then used as the loop counter.
 *                                 
 * Uses / Updates:
 *   current_track                 Working track cursor; set from start_track, advanced per sector.
 *   current_sector                Working sector cursor; set from start_sector, advanced per sector.
 *   disk_src_ptr                  Advanced by +256 after each successful sector.
 *   disk_copy_count_hi 			  Countdown of sectors remaining; 0 on completion.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   current_track/current_sector  Positioned at the sector immediately **after** the last one written.
 *   (no status flags)             This wrapper does not define a carry/flag contract on return.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   Modified by subroutines and internal ops; callers must not rely on flags after return.
 *
 * Clobbers:
 *   A, X, Y                       Not preserved. Calls disk_write_sector, disk_next_sector_phys,

 *
 * Description:
 *   1) Initialize disk_src_ptr from X/Y; seed current_track/current_sector from start_*.
 *   2) Compute sectors_to_write = hi + (lo != 0); reuse the hi byte as the sector countdown.
 *   3) Loop:
 *        • Map I/O in ($01 ← MAP_IO_ON).
 *        • LDX current_track, LDY current_sector, JSR disk_write_sector.
 *        • On C=1 (error): set msg_to_print_ptr to DISK_ERROR_MSG, print, and retry same sector.
 *        • On C=0 (success):
 *            – Map I/O out ($01 ← MAP_IO_OFF).
 *            – JSR disk_next_sector_phys (advance geometry).
 *            – INC disk_src_ptr+1 (advance buffer by +256).
 *            – DEC disk_copy_count_hi; if not zero, repeat.
 *   Note:
 *     • This routine can block indefinitely if a sector persistently fails (retries until success).
 *     • Preconditions: if both counter bytes are 0, no sectors should be written

 *   Uses self-modifying code to patch an absolute LDA operand, enabling a tight

/*
 * ===========================================
 * disk_reset — issue drive reset opcode over IEC
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Sends DISK_CMD_RESET to the disk drive using the low-level transmit
 *   routine. No track/sector parameters are used; the command is a single
 *   operation byte that instructs the drive to reset itself.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   (none)                    The routine loads A with DISK_CMD_RESET internally.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   (none)                    No success/failure code is returned by this wrapper.
 *   Registers                 A/X/Y clobbered by callees; condition flags updated.
 *
 * Description:
 *   Loads A with DISK_CMD_RESET and calls iec_send_cmd, which performs
 *   the IEC handshake and byte framing. 
 *
 * 	After the command is sent, the routine returns immediately; the drive completes 
 * 	its own reset/initialization.
 *
 *   Callers should re-synchronize with the bus and/or reinitialize any cached
 *   drive state as needed after invoking this routine.
 * ===========================================

 * ===========================================
 * disk_read_sector — receive a sector into caller buffer (handles escapes & EOD)
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 *   Sends a DISK_CMD_READ for (track=X, sector=Y), synchronizes with the drive,
 *   then streams the sector payload into the caller-provided buffer at disk_dest_ptr.
 *
 *   Bytes are received one-by-one; a prefix 0x01 introduces special sequences:
 *     01 01 → literal 0x01 (escaped)          	→ store and continue
 *     01 81 → end-of-data (success)          	→ C=0, RTS
 *     01 11 → error                            	→ C=1, RTS
 *     01 21 → sync request                     	→ resync, continue
 *   Any other 01 xx causes a deliberate hang (border=green) for debugging.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   X 		                      Track number to read.
 *   Y 		                      Sector number to read.
 *   disk_dest_ptr 		          Destination base address (lo/hi). The routine
 *                                 self-modifies an absolute STA $FFFF,X to target disk_dest_ptr.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   Caller must ensure the destination region is large enough; the routine
 *   continues writing beyond the first page if EOD is delayed.
 *
 *   Carry                         C=0 on success (EOD seen), C=1 on error marker.
 * 	disk_dest_ptr onward               Data stored starting at disk_dest_ptr; if X wraps, the
 *                                 patched high byte is incremented and writes continue
 *                                 into the next page until EOD.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   Z/N                           From the last data CMP/STA path (undefined contract).
 *
 * Clobbers:
 *   A, X, Y, C                    X is used as the running byte offset (0..255).
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   1) Latches track/sector into iec_cmd_track/iec_cmd_sector.
 *
 *   2) Patches the absolute store operand (disk_store_abs) with disk_dest_ptr, so
 *      each data byte is stored via STA abs(disk_dest_ptr)+X (self-modified). When X wraps ($FF→$00), the
 *      patched high byte is incremented to advance to the next page.
 *
 *   3) Issues the command via iec_send_cmd, then calls iec_sync.
 *
 *   4) Receives bytes with iec_recv_byte, interpreting 0x01-prefixed
 *      sequences as protocol control. On SYNC request (01 21), performs a sync and
 *      resumes the stream without losing position.
 *
 *   5) On DISK_RX_EOD returns C=0; on DISK_RX_ERR returns C=1. Any unknown
 *      01 xx pattern enters hang_loop after painting the border green.
