/*
 * ===========================================
 * IEC serial bit-banging via CIA2 PRA
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Low-level send/receive primitives for the Commodore IEC serial bus using
 *   CIA2 Port A. Bytes are transferred MSB-first by splitting each
 *   byte into four two-bit phases (ODD/EVEN clock levels). The module also
 *   provides a synchronization preamble that polls CLK-IN, then drives ATN
 *   to a defined state before traffic.
 *
 * Public routines:
 *   iec_send_cmd   		Send 3-byte command: track → sector → operation.
 *   iec_sync         	Pre/post delays, poll CLK-IN until set, write IEC_MASK_ATN_RELEASE.
 *   iec_recv_byte   	Read one byte via four two-bit sampling phases.
 *   iec_send_byte   	Send one byte via four two-bit transmit phases.
 *
 * Private routines:
 *   iec_recv_pair       Sample two bits (odd/even) into iec_shiftreg (ROL A → C → ROL iec_shiftreg).
 *   iec_send_pair       Transmit two bits (ROL iec_shiftreg → C; select PRA mask by C; ODD then EVEN).
 *
 * Hardware / IO:
 *   CIA2 Port A (PRA) drives/reads IEC lines through inverters (active-low bus).
 *   Writes in this module use full-byte masks; see Variables/Constants for bit meanings.
 *   Assumes DDRA configured so: DATA/CLK/ATN outputs are enabled; CLK-IN is readable.
 *
 * Conventions & invariants:
 *   • Bit order: MSB-first on both RX and TX (symmetry via ROL usage).
 *   • Two-phase framing: ODD (CLOCK high) then EVEN (CLOCK low) per 2 bits.
 *   • ATN polarity: IEC_MASK_ATN_RELEASE sets PRA ATN bit=1 (line released on the bus).
 *   • Timing: fixed cycle gaps (small register shuffles) form the required waveform.
 *   • Masks keep TXD (bit 2) high to avoid user-port glitches when writing full PRA.
 *
 * Variables / constants:
 *   See the “Variables / Constants” section below for PRA bit masks, composite
 *   phase masks, timing constants (PRE/POST sync delays), and working storage
 *   (iec_shiftreg, iec_cmd_track/sector, PRA address).
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *   • DDRA must set IEC output bits to output and CLK-IN to input.
 *   • VIC bank selection (PRA bits 0–1) is clobbered in these routines
 *
 * Returns / side effects:
 *   • Routines commonly clobber A, Y, and condition flags; X is preserved by most
 *     wrappers but may be used inside timing gaps—see each routine header.
 *   • Bus lines reflect the last phase mask written on exit from send/recv helpers.
 *
 * Notes / edge cases:
 *   • Sync waits while (IEC_PRA_CLK_IN & PRA)==0 and proceeds when it reads 1
 *     (post-inversion “released” on IEC).

 * iec_send_cmd — transmit (track, sector, op) over CIA2 serial
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Presets CIA2 PRA to a known idle/output mask, synchronizes with the drive,

 *   Each byte is sent via iec_send_byte.

 * Summary:
