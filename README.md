This is a reconstructed and commented disassembly of the C64 implementation of Maniac Mansion, for educational and research purposes only.
It includes the main engine code, as well as the special disk loaders used.

100% of the code is now commented. There are some naming and explanation improvements still pending.

I'm sure I'm not the first to analyze the code, as crackers of old necessarily had to do so to defeat copy protection. 
And at least one modern conversion to cartridge format exists, which forced the author to do analysis at a relatively deep level.

My goal is to preserve and document one of the culturally and technically significant videogames of its era, from the implementation side.

Corrections and improvements are welcome. Hope you have fun.
