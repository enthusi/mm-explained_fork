/*========================================================
 * camera.asm — Camera control & view-window maintenance
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Core camera routines. Provides:
 *     • cam_upd_target  – per-tick camera stepper driven by cam_mode.
 *     • cam_follow_costume – switch to the room of a target costume (if needed)
 *       and begin following its actor.
 *     • cam_seek_to     – decide snap vs pan to a requested position.
 *
 *   - Modes:
 *       CAM_MODE_PAN            – step 1 column toward cam_pan_goal each tick.
 *       CAM_MODE_FOLLOW_ACTOR   – keep actor inside follow window and step toward it when exceeded.
 *
 * Coordinate model:
 *   - All positions are “columns” in room space.
 *   - The visible window is 40 columns wide (0x28), centered at cam_target_pos.
 *   - VIEW_HALF_SPAN (0x14) is the center-to-edge offset; right edge is
 *     left + VIEW_FULL_SPAN_MINUS1 (0x27, inclusive).
 *
 * Behavior notes / edge cases:
 *   - cam_seek_to uses an absolute 8-bit distance (mod-256) against CAM_PAN_THRESHOLD;
 *     ≤ threshold → pan (set cam_pan_goal), > threshold → snap (set cam_target_pos & cam_pan_goal).
 *   - FOLLOW mode uses a left/right “follow window” measured from the edges of the view span.
 *     Crossing either threshold sets actor_follow_needs_pan and steps one column per tick.
 *   - Clamping guarantees the view never extends beyond room bounds:
 *     cam_target_pos ∈ [VIEW_HALF_SPAN, room_width − VIEW_HALF_SPAN].
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - Unless stated, A/X/Y and NZCV flags are clobbered.
 *   - actor_for_costume / costume_for_actor use bit7=1 as “unassigned”.

/*========================================================
 * cam_upd_target — advance camera one step based on mode, then update view edges
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Dispatches on cam_mode and adjusts cam_target_pos accordingly:
 *     - CAM_MODE_PAN: step 1 column toward cam_pan_goal (left/right).
 *     - CAM_MODE_FOLLOW_ACTOR: keep the followed actor within a horizontal
 *       window [left_follow_threshold .. right_follow_threshold] relative to
 *       viewport_left_col; when exceeded, step one column toward the actor.
 * 
 *   After movement (or if no movement), clamps cam_target_pos to room bounds
 *   and derives the visible span [viewport_left_col, viewport_right_col].
 *
 * Arguments (globals read):
 *   cam_mode                         Camera behavior selector.
 *   cam_target_pos                   Current camera center column.
 *   cam_pan_goal                     Target column for PAN mode.
 *   cam_follow_costume_id            Costume whose actor is followed (FOLLOW mode).
 *   actor_for_costume[ ]            Costume→actor slot map (FOLLOW mode).
 *   position_x_for_actor[ ]         Actor X positions (FOLLOW mode).
 *   viewport_left_col             Current left edge (for FOLLOW window tests).
 * Vars:
 *   left_follow_threshold            Columns from left edge that define left window bound.
 *   right_follow_threshold           Columns from right edge that define right window bound.
 *   room_width                       Room width in columns.
 *
 * Returns / side effects (globals written):
 *   cam_target_pos                   Stepped toward goal/actor and clamped to bounds.
 *   actor_follow_needs_pan           Set/cleared when FOLLOW window is crossed/met.
 *   viewport_left_col             Updated from cam_target_pos (center - VIEW_HALF_SPAN).
 *   viewport_right_col            Updated from left_edge (+ VIEW_FULL_SPAN_MINUS1).
 *
 * Flags:
 *   Not preserved. Internal CMP/SBC/ADC modify NZCV.
 *
 * Description:
 *   1) If CAM_MODE_PAN: compare cam_target_pos vs cam_pan_goal and step ±1, then clamp.
 *   2) Else if CAM_MODE_FOLLOW_ACTOR:
 *        - Sample actor X for the followed costume.
 *        - Compute (actor_x - viewport_left_col) and compare against follow window.
 *        - If outside window, step cam_target_pos one px toward actor.
 *      Clamp afterward.
 *   3) Clamp ensures the 40-col view (centered at cam_target_pos) never exceeds room edges.
 *   4) Finally, compute [viewport_left_col, viewport_right_col] from cam_target_pos.

 * cam_follow_costume : Follow a costume’s actor; switch rooms if needed.
 *
 * Summary:
 *   Puts the camera into “follow actor” mode for the costume ID provided by the caller.
 *   If that costume’s actor is not in the current room, transitions to the correct room,
 *   then seeks the camera toward the actor’s X position.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   A (costume id)        Index of the costume/character to follow.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A, X, Y               Clobbered.
 *   Flags                 Updated per last loads/stores/branches (no contract).

 *                         cam_pan_goal (via cam_seek_to); may change current_room (via load_room);
 *                         animation_state_for_actor[0..3] bit0 set for assigned actors.
 *
 * Description:
 *   1) Save the costume id and set camera mode to FOLLOW.
 *   2) Look up costume_room_idx[costume]; if it differs from current_room, prepare video
 *      state and load the target room. (Loader ABI expects room index in X.)
 *   3) Resolve the actor slot bound to that costume (actor_for_costume[costume]) and
 *      feed its X coordinate (position_x_for_actor[y]) into cam_seek_to to pan/snap.
 *   4) Initialize cam_current_pos to a default baseline (prevents initial jitter).
 *   5) For actor slots 3..0: if assigned (costume_for_actor[x] bit7=0), set
 *      animation_state_for_actor[x].bit0 = 1

  cam_seek_to: snap or pan camera to a target

  Summary:
    Decides between an instant jump (snap) and a smooth movement (pan)
    toward a requested camera position. Uses an absolute 8-bit distance
    and an inclusive threshold to choose the behavior.

  Arguments:
    A 		                    Requested camera destination (0..255).
  State:
    cam_target_pos           	Current/latched camera position/target.
    cam_pan_goal             	Pan system’s goal position.

  Returns:
    cam_target_pos              Updated only on snap (set to request).
    cam_pan_goal                Always set to request (snap or pan).
    Flags                       Unchanged at return.

  Description:
    Copies the requested position, computes |request − cam_target_pos|
    as an unsigned 8-bit difference (mod 256), and compares it against
    CAM_PAN_THRESHOLD. If the distance is ≤ threshold, it queues a pan by
    writing cam_pan_goal (leaving cam_target_pos for the pan system to
    advance). If the distance is > threshold, it snaps immediately by
    writing both cam_target_pos and cam_pan_goal to the requested value.
    Notes:
      - Distance is modulo-256; wraparound (e.g., 0↔255) is treated as
        a short 1-unit difference.
      - Threshold test is inclusive (≤).
      - Two’s-complement is used to absolute-value negative deltas.
